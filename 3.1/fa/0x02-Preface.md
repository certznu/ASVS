# Preface

Welcome to the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) version 3.1. The ASVS is a community-effort to establish a framework of security requirements and controls that focus on normalising the functional and non-functional security controls required when designing, developing and testing modern web applications.
ASVS v3.1 is a culmination of community effort and industry feedback. In this release, we felt it was important to qualify the experiences of real world use cases relating to ASVS adoption. This will help newcomers to the standard plan their adoption of the ASVS, whilst assisting existing companies in learning from the experience of others.

We expect that there will most likely never be 100% agreement on this standard. Risk analysis is always subjective to some extent, which creates a challenge when attempting to generalize in a one size fits all standard. However, we hope that the latest updates made in this version are a step in the right direction, and respectfully enhance the concepts introduced in this important industry standard.
